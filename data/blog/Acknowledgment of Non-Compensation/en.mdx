# Acknowledgment of Non-Compensation

Welcome to **GUTRICIOUS** as you embark on this journey with us through the use of our services, including the submission of biological Samples and Self-reported Health Information, we need to clarify the nature of your contribution. By participating, you understand and agree that you will not receive any form of compensation, be it cash, equity, or any other financial benefits or rewards, for the use of your Samples or any data generated from them. This includes their analysis, processing, participation in research and development activities, or their inclusion in datasets shared with our research partners, which may include commercial entities.

## Understanding Your Contribution

Your involvement with **GUTRICIOUS** does not endow you with any proprietary rights or interests in any research outcomes or commercial products that may emerge from our work or that of our partners. Specifically, this means you acknowledge that you will not be compensated for any research results or commercial products developed with, facilitated by, or resulting directly from your Samples or any information you provide to us.
