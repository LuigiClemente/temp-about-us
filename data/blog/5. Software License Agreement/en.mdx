# Software License Agreement

Welcome to the legal framework governing your use of **GUTRICIOUS** software, encompassing our website and applications—collectively referred to as "Software". This agreement delineates your rights and restrictions concerning the Software, not covered by any separate license.

## Authorized Access and Use

The rights granted to you for the Software, absent a distinct license agreement, are specified within these Terms. You are barred from copying, modifying, producing derivative works, reverse-engineering, disassembling, or decoding any source code. Additionally, selling, assigning, sublicensing, imposing a lien upon, or transferring any rights in the Software without explicit written consent from **GUTRICIOUS** is prohibited. You commit to refraining from altering the Software or utilizing modified versions for unauthorized access. Your access to the Service must solely be through interfaces provided by **GUTRICIOUS**. All rights not expressly given are reserved to **GUTRICIOUS**.

## License Grant

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, **GUTRICIOUS** grants you a limited, non-exclusive, and revocable license for personal, non-commercial use of the Service and Materials. This license remains valid until termination by either you or **GUTRICIOUS**. You are obliged to use the Service solely for personal, non-commercial ends, without redistributing or transferring the Service or any Materials.

Your usage must align with these Terms, avoiding any utilization of the Service or its components in a manner not directly authorized herein. Beyond the rights explicitly granted to you here, no further rights, titles, or interests in the Service or Materials are implied or granted. You are prohibited from copying, altering, creating derivative works, reverse-engineering, disassembling, or attempting to extract source code, and from selling, assigning, sublicensing, encumbering, or transferring any content of the Service or Materials, unless expressly agreed in a distinct written agreement with **GUTRICIOUS**.

**GUTRICIOUS** software, as part of the Service, is licensed to you—not sold. **GUTRICIOUS** and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the **GUTRICIOUS** Software, even after installation on your devices. The Service may include third-party software, such as open-source libraries, available under these Terms or the third-party licenses specified within the software’s help, about, or settings menus, or on our website.
