# **Service Provision "As Is"**

Welcome to **GUTRICIOUS**, where we offer our Service on an “as is” and “as available” basis, providing no guarantees of any kind, whether they are stated outright or implied by use. It's important for you to know that both we and our partners—licensors and suppliers—expressly reject all warranties. These disclaimed warranties range widely, from those that are explicitly stated to those that are implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of being sellable, fitting for a particular purpose, holding title, and not infringing on others' rights, alongside any assurance of service continuity or freedom from errors.

Our commitment to maintaining the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of the materials, including information accessible via our Service, has its limits. **GUTRICIOUS** is not responsible for any inaccuracies or omissions in the content or materials provided through our Service. Despite our efforts to secure the safety and integrity of our Service, we cannot promise that our Service or its servers, or any content and materials therein, are free from viruses or other harmful components.

We suggest that users take protective measures by utilizing reputable software solutions to detect and neutralize viruses, spyware, malware, and other potentially dangerous or unwanted threats during their use of our Service.
