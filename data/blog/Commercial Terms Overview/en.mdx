# Commercial Terms Overview

Welcome to **GUTRICIOUS** where we provide a range of paid services to enhance your health journey, including **Testing (with Results)** and various **Membership** options. 

## Fees & Charges

- **Testing and Results**: This service requires a fixed payment. You may choose to pay this amount either upfront or in installments during the purchase process.
- **Membership**: We offer membership through a subscription model, allowing you to choose how often you're billedâ€”monthly or annually. We might also provide the option to pay a lump sum upfront.

Please note, prices are subject to change with a 30-day notice before the next billing period. All listed fees do not include taxes, which are your responsibility. Changes in tax rates could affect your final payment amount.

## Duration of Membership

Your membership will begin once you receive your test results and will continue without interruption unless you decide to cancel. Please be aware that we do not offer refunds for any unused membership time.

## Acceptance of Orders

At **GUTRICIOUS**, we reserve the right to accept or decline any orders. We may also adjust our service prices without prior notification. However, for active subscriptions, the price agreed upon at the start of the subscription period will not change.

## Billing & Payments

- Your payments may be processed directly by us or through a third-party provider, such as Stripe.
- You commit to paying with the payment method you've selected and to keeping your billing information up to date and accurate.
- It's your responsibility to inform **GUTRICIOUS** of any changes to your payment method or if you suspect any issues regarding payment security.

## Returns and Refund Policy

- All sales of Test Kits are final. We may offer refunds for kits that are damaged or defective prior to sample submission, under certain conditions.
- Memberships may be canceled at any time, but refunds will not be provided. You can continue to use the service until the end of your current billing period.
- **GUTRICIOUS** may, under exceptional circumstances, choose to issue refunds at its discretion.

## Termination of Agreement

We may end this agreement if you breach the terms, due to legal requirements, or for other reasons, thereby revoking all access and rights granted to you. Termination does not impact any obligations accrued before termination or any rights and obligations that are intended to survive termination.
