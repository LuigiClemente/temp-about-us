# Limitation of Liability Overview

Welcome to the legal safeguards of **GUTRICIOUS** We aim to clarify the extent of our liability regarding your use of our services. Under the broadest legal allowances, neither **GUTRICIOUS** nor its associates—this encompasses affiliates, successors, contractors, service providers, consultants, licensors, suppliers, and their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents—will be held accountable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. This includes, without limitation, financial losses from disrupted business, data breaches, loss of profits, computer failures, or inaccuracies in outcomes, irrespective of the legal framework (be it tort, contract, or any other legal theory) used to establish such claims. Specifically, our liability does not cover:

- Damages not directly caused by our services, such as profit loss, data corruption, or hardware malfunction.
- Expenses for obtaining replacement goods, services, or technology.
- Our financial liability is limited to the larger amount between one hundred (€100) euros or the sum you have paid us for the service within the last 12 months before the claim.
- Losses beyond our control, including natural disasters, government actions, pandemics, or labor disputes. The enforceability of these limitations might vary based on your jurisdiction.

## External Links and Third-Party Services

**GUTRICIOUS** assumes no responsibility for the content, policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services accessible through our Service. Interactions with such third-party entities carry inherent risks, and we advise caution and due diligence before engagement. It is recommended to familiarize yourself with the terms and privacy policies of any third-party platforms you intend to visit.

## Interactions with Third Parties

Transactions or communications with third-party entities discovered through our Service are strictly between you and the respective third parties. **GUTRICIOUS** bears no liability for any harm or loss incurred from such dealings. Should disputes arise with one or more third parties, **GUTRICIOUS** has no obligation to participate or mediate. Your use of our Service signifies your agreement to absolve **GUTRICIOUS** and its personnel from any claims, known or unknown, associated with third-party disputes. This includes waiving any legal safeguards that might limit a general release's scope, acknowledging that this waiver extends to all claims, regardless of their discovery, that originate from or are connected with our Service.
