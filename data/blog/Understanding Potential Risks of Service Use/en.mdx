# Understanding Potential Risks of Service Use

Welcome to the section where we discuss the potential risks associated with using **GUTRICIOUS** services. As part of your journey with us, it's essential to be aware of the inherent challenges and considerations involved, especially when it comes to the collection and analysis of Samples. These risks are crucial for a well-informed decision-making process and include, but are not limited to, the following:

## Potential Risks

- **Discomfort During Sample Collection:** Gathering Samples might lead to feelings of unease or discomfort.
  
- **Allergic Reactions:** Our nutritional recommendations might include items that could trigger allergic reactions. If you're aware of any allergies or sensitivities, please steer clear of these suggestions.
  
- **Health Conditions:** There's a chance that existing health issues may not improve or might deteriorate, and new health concerns could arise.
  
- **Emotional Discomfort:** Certain survey questions might be uncomfortable or sensitive for you or your loved ones.
  
- **Follow-up Costs:** Uncovering new health information could require further medical consultations, with associated costs for additional testing and treatments falling under your responsibility.
  
- **Anxiety and Worry:** Gaining new insights into your personal health could increase feelings of worry or anxiety.
  
- **Pain or Discomfort from Sample Collection:** Services necessitating blood samples, such as using a lancet, may cause pain, bleeding, or even fainting. While minor, there's a slight infection risk at the collection site.
  
- **No Compensation for Injuries:** GUTRICIOUS does not provide compensation or treatment for injuries incurred during the Sample collection process.
  
- **Unforeseeable Risks:** Participation may bring risks currently unknown or unforeseeable.

Your health and safety are paramount to us. We urge you to consider these risks carefully as you decide to proceed with our services. Making an informed choice is critical to ensuring your health and well-being remain our top priority.
