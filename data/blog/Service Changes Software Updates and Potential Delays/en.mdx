# Service Changes, Software Updates, and Potential Delays

Welcome to **GUTRICIOUS** your trusted partner in health and wellness. We want you to be aware that **GUTRICIOUS** reserves the right to modify, refine, suspend, or discontinue any part of our Service at any time, with or without notice to you. These changes may affect how and when you receive results from our services. To ensure you're always getting the most from our Service, the Software and App you use may automatically download and install updates from **GUTRICIOUS**. These updates are designed to enhance your experience by providing bug fixes, new features, additional software modules, or entirely new versions of the Software. By continuing to use our Service, you agree to accept these updates as part of your usage agreement with **GUTRICIOUS**.

## Understanding Delays

Delays in the service delivery can occur for several reasons. If you're slow in responding to our initial request for Self-Reported Health Information, or if there's a delay in providing any additional information or materials requested (such as biological Samples), this can postpone the start of the testing phase and delay your results. Additionally, the processing of Samples by our third-party laboratory partners may encounter unforeseen delays, affecting the analysis and subsequent delivery of your Test Data to **GUTRICIOUS**. While we may not always notify you of these delays, be assured that **GUTRICIOUS** is committed to taking all commercially reasonable steps to minimize their impact. However, **GUTRICIOUS** is not liable for any inconvenience or delay you or any third party may experience due to these operational issues.
