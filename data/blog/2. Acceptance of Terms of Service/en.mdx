# Acceptance of Terms of Service

Welcome to **GUTRICIOUS** your gateway to a comprehensive suite of services tailored to enrich your health and wellness journey. By leveraging our advanced software applications, user-friendly websites, mobile apps, and engaging in our unique research programs, you're embarking on a transformative experience. Our services span from collecting Self-Reported Health Information to partnering with third-party laboratories for the detailed analysis of biological Samples.

## Agreement Overview

By utilizing any aspect of our service—whether it’s accessing, browsing, purchasing, subscribing, or simply clicking to accept these Terms—you're acknowledging and agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with **GUTRICIOUS**, and our Affiliates. Here, "Affiliates" include any entity or individual that holds a controlling interest, is controlled by, or is under common ownership with GUTRICIOUS, 

### **Critical Consideration**

Before diving into the rich features and services we offer, we urge you to thoroughly review these Terms of Service (“**Terms**”). They encompass essential information about your interaction with our services, including:

- Potential modifications to these Terms
- Limitations of liability
- A waiver for class action suits
- A preference for arbitration over traditional court disputes
- The authority you grant to GUTRICIOUS to sign documentation on your behalf

**Your commitment to these Terms is solidified through your continued access and use of our Service.**

### **Arbitration Notice & Class Action Waiver**

It’s important to note that most disputes under these Terms will be resolved through binding, individual arbitration. This means that you waive any right to participate in class action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration, aiming for a more streamlined and personal approach to dispute resolution.

### **Service-Specific Agreements**

Certain features of our Service, such as optional research programs, come with their own set of rules. These specific agreements or consent forms will be presented to you for approval when you opt to engage with those special features. Should there be any conflict between the general Terms and the specific terms for certain services, the latter will prevail.

### **Consequences of Non-Agreement**

If you find these Terms not to your liking, the only recourse is to stop using all GUTRICIOUS services immediately. Your access and usage of the Service, including any accounts you may hold with GUTRICIOUS, hinge entirely on your adherence to these Terms. We reserve the right to terminate your access and use of the Service, including your account, without prior notice, should you fail to comply with any aspect of these Terms.
