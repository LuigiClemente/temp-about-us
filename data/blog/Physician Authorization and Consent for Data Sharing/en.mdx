# Physician Authorization and Consent for Data Sharing

Engaging with **GUTRICIOUS Service** involves entering into an agreement that is crucial for the provision of our services, particularly when regulations require physician authorization for direct-to-consumer laboratory tests. By accepting these Terms, you acknowledge and consent to the following under United States law:

## Authorization to Share Personal Data

You hereby grant **GUTRICIOUS** the permission to share your personal information, which includes Customer Information, Sample data, test data, Test Data, Self-reported Health Information, and any medical details, with laboratories and their physicians. This disclosure is essential for the effective delivery of the Service.

## Authorization for Documentation Signing

Furthermore, you empower **GUTRICIOUS** to sign on your behalf any documents necessary to facilitate these services, ensuring a seamless and efficient process.

### **Your Explicit Agreement**

By agreeing to these Terms, you explicitly authorize **GUTRICIOUS** to use and disclose your health information as detailed above. This includes all information you provide, as well as laboratory test results, shared among you, **GUTRICIOUS** and its affiliates, the participating laboratories, and certain service providers, as legally allowed or required.

### **Revoking Authorization**

- You have the right to withdraw this authorization at any time by sending a written notice to **GUTRICIOUS**, which will impact future use of your information but not retroactively affect any previously shared data or actions taken under this consent. Withdrawal of this consent means you will no longer be able to use the **GUTRICIOUS Service**.

- To revoke, direct your written notice to hello@joinGUTRICIOUScom or through the appropriate channel at www.joinGUTRICIOUScom/dpo.

### **GDPR and Your Rights**

This agreement respects your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (**GDPR**). Our Privacy Policy
