## Medical Disclaimer

**GUTRICIOUS** does not dispense medical advice or offer medical services. The insights and recommendations we provide through our service are not to be taken as medical counsel. Crucially, interacting with our service does not create a doctor-patient relationship. In emergencies, promptly contact emergency services by dialing 112.

## No Doctor-Patient Relationship

The service provided by **GUTRICIOUS** is designed for informational purposes only. We do not offer medical advice or services. The information and results generated by our service should not be interpreted as medical advice, diagnoses, or substitutes for professional medical consultation.
