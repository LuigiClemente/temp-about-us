# Engagement in Research Initiatives

As you embark on the journey of participating in research initiatives with **GUTRICIOUS**, it's important to understand this adds a new dimension to your existing commitments under our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
. Your decision to engage means you'll need to carefully review and agree to a special document known as the **Research Informed Consent**. This key document outlines what your participation involves and, where applicable, obtains your consent for any additional processing of your Personal Data by **GUTRICIOUS** in the context of the research.

In instances where the information you've provided to us indicates you are a potential fit for specific research projects, you give **GUTRICIOUS** your express permission to reach out to you. This outreach could be through email or directly via our Software or App, with the goal of sharing the pertinent informed consent form with you. Your agreement to this form is crucial; it serves as the green light for us to incorporate your Personal Data into the research activities, thereby allowing you to contribute meaningfully to our collective understanding and advancements in health and wellness.
